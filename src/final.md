## Description

The final performance will take place on Thursday, May 15th, from 9:00 PM to 12:00 AM at EXIT Shanghai (Xingfu Rd 298, Shanghai, China).

You will develop a 10-minute final performance in pairs - usually with one person focusing on audio and one on visuals, but you're encouraged to think about other, more fluid forms of collaboration. (Individual performance is also possible upon instructor approval)

## Performance Overview

Your performance should demonstrate both technical proficiency and artistic expression, combining preparation with live improvisation. Remember to allow space for real-time exploration and unexpected moments that make live coding performances unique, dynamic, and engaging.

The venue will have a screen and a seperate projector - you should decide and design your interfaces, including how and whether to combine screens, what to expose, what to hide, and how to structure your performance space.

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- As a group, use at least two tools covered in class, at least one of which must be code-based
- Design and implement your performance interface considering the available setup
- Document your planning process, code, and performance

### Performance Requirements
- 10-minute performance duration, with a clear beginning, middle, and end
- Balance between preparation and improvisation, considering the liveliness of the experience
- Both performers must conduct live manipulation of the interface
- Demonstrate creative understanding of the tools used
