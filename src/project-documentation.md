## Hosting Your Documentation

### Google Site
If you have taken an IMA foundational class and have a Google Site, you can use the same site to host your blog - just create a separate section / page for our class :)

### Notion
Alternatively, Notion is a great platform to make a public blog/documentation page. Follow Notion site publishing guideline [here](https://www.notion.com/help/public-pages-and-web-publishing)

### Other Platforms
Documentation hosted on other platforms or sites are welcome too! You can use Google Slides, Google Docs, Figma, Miro, GitHub Pages, ??? as long as you make it look nice and you can generate a link publicly available on the internet.

## Submission
Submit the link to your blog posts through the [homework form](). 

## Weekly Assignments

Each week, there will be a Sketch assignment and a Reading Reflection assignment with occassional exceptions. Unless otherwise specified, weekly blog posts should include:

### for Sketch
- Link to your sketch
- What was your creative intention?
- What was one technical challenge that was particularly fun or difficult, how did you approach or explore it?

### for Reading Reflection
- Which Reading was it for
- In your own sentences, what are 2-3 concepts or ideas that stood out to you?
- Share one question or critique that emerged for you while reading. This could be something you'd like to discuss further in class, or an idea you'd like to challenge.

## Midterm and Final Project Documentation

Gather and compile your performance materials into a documentation page, alongside your personal written reflection. Format could be creative, but the page should be accessable via a link on the internet.

### Content to Include

- **Introduction**: Brief explanation of the work - artists involved, concept, and artistic statement (should be co-authored by the group)
- **Collaborative Reflection**: How did your group divide roles and responsibilities during the performance? How did you communicate? Compare your planned approaches with what actually happened.
- **Technical Documentation**: Notes on what you learned about your tools through this performance. In what ways did the constraints of the technology lead to unexpected creative outcomes? Share some technical details of snippets you contributed that you feel particularly proud of.
- **Process & Experience**: How did the performance come into shape? What are some moments during the performance that stood out to you? Share any artifacts, media, and additional materials from your practice sessions.
- **Credits and References**: Inspirations, code, who helped you, etc.
- **Photo and Video documentation**: Include some photos, whether screenshots or performance photos. Feel free to upload your performance video to Youtube, Vimeo etc. and include in your documentation. You can also re-record a different version, or combine / edit things. It's not uncommon for artists to edit and re-record live performances for documentation purposes...
