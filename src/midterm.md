## Description

The midterm performance will take place at Cedar Kitchen, Monday October 20.

For your midterm, you will be participating in a collective jam session in 3 different groups, and each group will develop a distinct 10-minute segment of audiovisual performance using Strudel and Hydra.

Taking inspiration from the Surrealist game of exquisite corpse, each group will also inherit and transform elements from the previous group's code, creating an evolving, continuous audiovisual experience in one Flok session.

## Process

While preparing, create a core audiovisual identity for your segment using Hydra and Strudel. Discuss with your adjacent groups (the groups that perform before and after you) to coordinate "handoffs" - as one section ends, inherit and transform at least one visual and one sonic element from the previous group during this transition. Signal and help your next group with transition afterwards.

The performance emphasizes both preparation and live improvisation - you can prepare as much, or as little as you wish, just know that the magic always happens in real time.

## Requirements

### Group Requirements
- Use both Hydra and Strudel
- Include at least one audio-reactive visual element
- Transform elements from the previous group
- Document your planning process and include comments in your code

### Individual Requirements
- Must contribute to both planning and performance
- Must use either Hydra or Strudel, or both
