                <p>The midterm performance will take place Wednesday, March 19 at Cedar Kitchen (272 Julu Rd, Jing'an
                    District) 7 PM - 9 PM </p>
                <p>For your midterm, you will be participating in a collective jam session in 5 different groups. Each
                    group will have 3-4 members - together, you will develop a distinct 10-minute segment of
                    audiovisual performance using Strudel and Hydra.</p>

                <p>Taking inspiration from the Surrealist game of exquisite corpse, each group will also inherit and
                    transform elements from the previous group's code, creating an evolving, continuous audiovisual
                    experience in one Flok session.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>While preparing, create a core audiovisual identity for your segment using Hydra and Strudel. Discuss
                with your adjacent groups (the groups that perform before and after you) to coordinate "handoffs" - as
                one section ends, inherit and transform at least one visual and one sonic element from the
                previous group during this transition. Signal and help your next group
                with transition afterwards. </p>
            </ul>
            <p>The performance emphasizes both preparation and live improvisation - you can prepare as much, or as
                little as you wish, just know that the magic always happens in real time. </p>
