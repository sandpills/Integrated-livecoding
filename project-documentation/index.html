<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong>: Brief explanation of the work - artists involved, concept, and artistic statement (should be co-authored by the group)</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative Reflection</strong>: How did your group divide roles and responsibilities during the performance? How did you communicate? Compare your planned approaches with what actually happened.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Documentation</strong>: Notes on what you learned about your tools through this performance. In what ways did the constraints of the technology lead to unexpected creative outcomes? Share some technical details of snippets you contributed that you feel particularly proud of.</li>
<li><strong>Process &amp; Experience</strong>: How did the performance come into shape? What are some moments during the performance that stood out to you? Share any artifacts, media, and additional materials from your practice sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Credits and References</strong>: Inspirations, code, who helped you, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Photo and Video documentation</strong>: Include some photos, whether screenshots or performance photos. Feel free to upload your performance video to Youtube, Vimeo etc. and include in your documentation. You can also re-record a different version, or combine / edit things. It's not uncommon for artists to edit and re-record live performances for documentation purposes...</li>
