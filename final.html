                <p>The final performance will take place on Thursday, May 15th, from 9:00 PM to 12:00 AM at EXIT
                    Shanghai (Xingfu Rd 298, Shanghai, China).</p>
                <p>You will develop a 10-minute final performance in pairs - usually with one person focusing on audio
                    and one on visuals, but you're encouraged to think about other, more fluid forms of collaboration.
                    (Individual performance is also possible upon instructor approval)
                </p>
                <p>The venue will have a screen and a seperate projector - you can decide how to design your interfaces,
                    combining screens, what to expose, and how to structure your performance space.</p>

            <h2>Performance Overview</h2>
            <p>Your performance should demonstrate both technical proficiency and artistic expression, combining
                preparation with live improvisation. Remember to allow space for real-time exploration and unexpected
                moments that make live coding performances unique, dynamic, and engaging.</p>
