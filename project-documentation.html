        <section>
            <p>Gather and compile your performance materials into a documentation page, alongside
                your personal written reflection. Each person should create their own page - format could be creative,
                but the page should be
                accessable via a
                link on the internet. Submit link through the homework form. Midterm documentation is due Friday, March
                28 11:59PM.
            </p>

            <h2>content to include</h2>
            <p>Introduction: Brief explanation of the work - artists involved, concept, and artistic statement (should
                be co-authored by the group)</p>
            <p>Collaborative Reflection: How did your group divide roles and responsibilities during the performance?
                How
                did you communicate? Compare your planned approaches with what actually happened.</p>
            <p>Technical Documentation: Notes on what you learned about your tools through this performance. In
                what ways did the constraints of the technology lead to unexpected creative outcomes? Share some
                technical details of snippets you contributed that you feel particularly proud of. </p>
            <p>Process & Experience: How did the performance come into shape? What are some moments during the
                performance that stood out to
                you? Share any artifacts, media, and additional materials from your practice sessions.</p>
            <p>Credits and References: Inspirations, code, who helped you, etc.</p>
            <p>Photo and Video documentation: Include some photos, whether screenshots or performance photos. Feel free
                to upload your performance video to Youtube, Vimeo etc. and include in
                your documentation. You can also re-record a different version, or combine / edit things. It's not
                uncommon for artists to edit and re-record live performances for documentation purposes... </p>
